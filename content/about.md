Hello! I'm Pablo Ram√≥n Guevara, a computer engineer from Spain. I graduated from the [University of Alicante](https://www.ua.es/) in 2023, with a degree in Computer Engineering and a specialization in computing in the High Performance group. You can read my final degree project [here](https://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/136544).

I'm passionate about functional programming, software engineering, and machine learning. I love working on challenging problems and learning new technologies.

## Work

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Multimedia Chefs](https://www.multimediachefs.com/), a company that provides multimedia solutions for many clients.

Here are a few technologies I've been enjoying working with lately:

- NixOS
- Elixir and Phoenix
- Rust
- Svelte
- TailwindCSS

## Books

I've been reading a lot of [ratfic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) lately as well. Here are some of my favorite books:

## Biohacking

As a transhumanist, I'm bullish on the future of biohacking. For example, here are some parts of my stack:

- Caffeine: never after 6 pm.
- Semaglutide: 2.4 mg once a week.
- Atorvastatin: 20 mg once a day, since I have the APOE4 allele.
- Dutasteride: 0.5 mg daily, for my hair.
- Minoxidil: 5% solution, twice a day, for my hair.
- Adapalene: once a day, anti-aging.

Other interventions include:

- Resistence training
- Sleep hygiene: after 00:00 no electronics.
